>Road safety is a major concern as nearly 1.3 million people die in road crahses each year and 20-50 million get injured. 
>In this hackathon you will use your tech skills and creativity to present a scalable solution to "make every life count".

Your objective is to prevent as many road crashes as possible. 

We have historical data of road crashes. Sample data is given below 
``` javascript
{ 
   "location" : {"latitude" : 24.4353, "longitude" : 78.3233}, 
   "damageRating" : 0.5,
   "killed" : 1, 
   "injured" : 2, 
   "datetime" : "2015-05-01T14:00:00.000Z" , 
   "crashDetail": "Car driver tried to take over another car from wrong side at 90kph hitting the truck standing by the side of road. Accident prone area."
} 
```
We want to make this data available for the public use through smart interface just in time. Also it's your job to figure out how this data can be used to prevent road crashes. Build an app(native/hybrid) as interface for end user. Make your own dummy data for road crashes.

>Assumptions
>* Everybody has a smartphone(android/ios) with excellent battery life 
>* Everybody has a decent internet connection in their phone

>How to submit the solution
>* Brief about the solution (share how is it useful) max 150 words (README file in code)
>* Share the code through git repository or in zip file with us so we can review the code
>* Screenshots wherever applicable
>* Brief about code structure and architecture.  (README file in code)
>* Anything special you want evaluation team to pay attention to, write that.
